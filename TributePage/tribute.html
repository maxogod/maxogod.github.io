          Uchiha Itachi (うちはイタチ) -man holding the kid- was a shinobi of
          Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain before
          abandoning his village for its sake.

        <h3>
          Here is a time line of the most relevant parts of Itachi's life:
        </h3>
        <h5>
          <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Itachi_Uchiha">Source</a>
        </h5>
        <ul id="time-line-list">
          <li>
            Itachi was the first child born to Mikoto and Fugaku Uchiha. His
            early childhood was marked with violence: when he was four years
            old, the Third Shinobi World War waged and he witnessed first-hand
            many of the war's casualties.
          </li>
          <li>
            The death and destruction he experienced at such a young age
            traumatised Itachi and made him a pacifist, leading to him training
            non-stop to achieve his dream of becoming a ninja among ninja in
            order to erase fighting from the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            At age 11, Itachi joined the Anbu as its youngest member
            demonstrating how talented and skilled he was.
          </li>
          <li>
            Itachi's accomplishments were a source of great pride for his
            family, his father viewing him as proof of the Uchiha's future
            prosperity and his brother viewing him as a model to live up to.
          </li>
          <li>
            Itachi knew an Uchiha coup that was starting to form would lead to
            intervention from other villages and ultimately start another World
            War, something he could not support. He instead became a double
            agent, reporting the Uchiha's actions to the Third Hokage and the
            Konoha Council in the hopes it would help them find a peaceful
            resolution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Although the Third Hokage still wished to negotiate with the Uchiha,
            Danzō Shimura recognised that there was no longer an outcome that
            could see the Uchiha clan's survival. He explained this to Itachi
            and left him a choice: support the Uchiha's coup and have the whole
            clan, including Sasuke, killed in the ensuing conflict, or accept
            the assignment to wipe out the clan before the coup started and be
            allowed to spare Sasuke which was his final choice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Years later he died by his own brother's hands, after years of
            tormenting him trying to get sasuke to hate him, so that sasuke
            would become strong enough to stop war in the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more
            complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in
            the interest of his brother and village, making him remain a loyal
            shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.
          </li>
          <li>
            Later on during the 4th great ninja war, he was revived by a
            forbidden jutsu to fight on the bad side, but he had prevented this
            and had a method to escape the control of his summoner, this way he
            ended up helping humanity win the war, after which a long time of
            peace on earth came along.
