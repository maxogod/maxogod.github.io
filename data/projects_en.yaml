It features a Kubernetes-based deployment, managed via Infrastructure as Code and automated with CI/CD pipelines. Monitoring is handled through Datadog for full observability. <br><br> The system supports both a React Native mobile app (for teachers and students) and a React web app (for administrators). It includes six microservices developed in Go (Gin Gonic) and Python (FastAPI), each with its own database using Supabase or MongoDB Atlas, all with >75% test coverage. An additional AI microservice powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash enables LLM-based assistance."

      description: "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) solution featuring a dynamic firewall built with POX and Mininet.<br><br>The project follows a modular Docker-based architecture that separates network emulation from controller logic, and uses Python 3 (with custom patches for POX compatibility).<br><br>Key features include:<br>- JSON-based configuration for defining IP, port, and protocol filtering rules.<br>- Centralized traffic control over OpenFlow switches via the POX controller.<br>- Automated testing and traffic validation using Mininet and Wireshark.<br><br>The system supports practical scenarios such as blocking HTTP traffic, dropping UDP flows, and restricting communication between specific hosts. It also addresses challenges like Python 3 migration and testing in more complex topologies."
